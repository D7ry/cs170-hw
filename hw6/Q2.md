## Q2

### a

Let `T` be the tree created by the algo, and `T'` be the tree that's an actual MST generated through Primm's algorithm.

If `T` and `T'` are identical, `T` is an MST and nothing is to be prooven.

If `T` and `T'` are different:

Let `E` be an edge that the algorithm adds to `T` when connecting 2 components, such that `E` differs from the edge that connects the same 2 components in `T'`. Such an edge must exist as all edges are generated by the algorithm, and some edges in `T` are different to `T'`.

Due to the algorithm, `E` is the smallest edge that connects the 2 components, smaller than the edge that connects the 2 components in `T'`.  Per the cut property, we can cut the 2 components in `T'` and connect them through `E`, which will form a MST that has a smaller edge sum the `T'`. This contradicts that `T'` is an MST. Hence `T` must be identical to `T'`, and therefore is an MST.

### b

O(log2(|V|))

First pass we have |V| connected components which are just singular vertices, by connecting 2 components together, we effectively reduce the number of problems to |V| / 2, and the following pass, |V| / 2 ^ i. 

Therefore it takes Log2(|V|) passes to connect all components.

### c

|V| + |V| / 2 + |V| / 4 ..... + 1 = O(2|V|) = O(|V|)
