## Q2

### Algorithm
```python
k:int = problem.getK()
adjacency_list = problem.getAdjacencyList()
root = problem.getRoot()
s:dict[Node, int] = {}

def search(node, depth):
    """
    @arg node
        current node we're traversing
    @arg depth
        depth of the current node, root node has depth of 0
    @return 
        a dictionary, mapping depth (in int) to the number nodes that are of that distance to the root node. Nodes including the current node, and all descendent node from the current node.s
    """
    ret = dict[int, int]()
    ret[depth] = 1 # record the node itself
    for child in adjacency_list[node]: # iterate over childs
        res = search(child, depth + 1) # depths of descendendents of one particular child

        # record the depths of descendents to this func's return value
        for child_depth in res:
            ret[child_depth] = 0 if child_depth not in ret
            ret[child_depth] += res[child_depth]

    # look at depths of all children, if the depth difference exceeds k between this node and the child, add the # of children.
    for child_depth in ret:
        if child_depth - depth >= k:
            s[node] += ret[child_depth]

    return ret

search(node=root, depth=0)
```

### Proof

First, to prove that the function returns a dictionary that maps an integer to the number of nodes that are of that integer's worth of distance deepth:

Proof by induction:  
- Base case: when a node contains no descendent, the return value is {node's depth : 1}, which is by itself correct.
- Assuming that recursive call returns correct result to a lower level, a recursive call on a child node gives us a map of all the child node's descendent's depths count. Since we're calling the recursive call on all child, the recursive call loop covers all descendents originating from the current node. In addition to the depth info of the current node being added at the beginning, the `search` function returns the correct result.

Now, before the `search()` function returns, it also calculates the difference between the current node and the descendents, and since from the above proof we know that the function returns all count of descendents' distances, we can safely compare the relative distance and add them to the answer. 

### Runtime
`search()` itself is bound to O(|E|) calls since it recurses the same way as DFS. Because the graph is a tree, |E| = |V| - 1 so `search()` is bound to O(|V|) calls. 

Looking inside `search()`, it runs in O(m) with m being the amount of child one node has. Due to the graph being a tree, each node can only be the child of any other node once, effectively making the combination of all `search()` recursion calls O(|V|).

The total runtime is thus O(2|V|) which simplifies to O(|V|)
