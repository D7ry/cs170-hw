## Q5


### a
For every other player that's not x, let them form a pair with x and make a said query. x is a human/werewolf when in more than 1/2 of the queries, the other player indicates that x is a human/werewolf. This is because there are more humans than werewolves always, so more than 1/2 of the queries always return the truth, when we query everyone on the same person. As much as the werewolve population want to lie they can only change the percentage of truth in the range that's exclusively bound by 50% and inclusively 100%.

### b

#### Algorithm

1. Using the method in **a** to find out true identity of an arbitrary player, x.
2. Divide all players in 2 groups, for each player in each group, query (player, x).
3. Due to the invariant that more than half of the players are human, at least one of the group 



#### Code

```Python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, is_human:bool=True):
        self.is_human:bool = is_human
    def lie(self) -> bool
        pass
    def ask(self, other_player):
        if self.is_human:
            return other_player.is_human
        else: # lie
            return self.lie()

def query(p1:Player, p2:Player):
    return (p1.ask(p2), p2.ask(p1))

def find_human(players:'list[Player]'):
