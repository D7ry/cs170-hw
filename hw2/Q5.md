## Q5


### a
For every other player that's not x, let them form a pair with x and make a said query. x is a human/werewolf when in more than 1/2 of the queries, the other player indicates that x is a human/werewolf. This is because there are more humans than werewolves always, so more than 1/2 of the queries always return the truth, when we query everyone on the same person. As much as the werewolve population want to lie they can only change the percentage of truth in the range that's exclusively bound by 50% and inclusively 100%.

### b

#### Algorithm

1. Using the method in **a** to find out true identity of an arbitrary player, x.
2. Divide all players in 2 groups, for each player in each group, query (player, x).
3. For each of the 2 divided groups, if more than half of the players return the correct answer for x, repeat 2-3 to that group, else discard the group(prune the tree).
4. Keep dividing the groups until we reach groups of 2.
5. Use method in **a** to find out which one of them is a human.

#### Proof

Because the invariant holds, the remaining groups always have more human than werewolves. This holds true until we reach groups of 2. Then we simply run one more pass using **a** solution to figure out which one in any arbitrary group is a human.

#### Runtime
Each recursion, or level of the tree, we multiply the problem number by 2 with halved problem size(number of players to query). At each level, for each player we run the query, so this results in O(n) queries being done on each recusion levlel.

The recusion goes on, halving the problem size until O(log(N)) levels where there are only 2 players, where we run the final pass.

So the runtime is O(nlog(n)) + O(n) = O(nlog(n))
#### Code

```Python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, is_human:bool=True):
        self.is_human:bool = is_human
    def lie(self) -> bool
        pass
    def ask(self, other_player):
        if self.is_human:
            return other_player.is_human
        else: # lie
            return self.lie()

def query(p1:Player, p2:Player):
    return (p1.ask(p2), p2.ask(p1))

def find_human(players:'list[Player]', player_with_known_id:Player):
    if len(players) == 2:
        return players[0] if q1_solution(players, players[0]) else players[1]
    correct_answer_count:int = 0
    for player in players:
        if query(player, player_with_known_id)[0] == player_with_known_id.is_human:
            correct_answer_count += 1
    if correct_answer_count <= len(players) // 2: # group is sus
        return None
    # divide and recurse
    g1 = players[:len(players)//2]
    g2 = players[len(players)//2:]
    g1_res = find_human(g1, player_with_known_id)
    g2_res = find_human(g2, player_with_known_id)
    ret = g1_res if g1_res is not None else g2_res
    return ret

def solution(players):
    return find_human(players, q1_solution(players, players[0]))
