## Q3
### Algorithm

1. The problem's state consist of 6 numbers:
    - count of number sets with odd # of numbers that sums up to 0 modulo 3
    - count of number sets with even # of numbers that sums up to 0 modulo 3
    - count of number sets with odd # of numbers that sums up to 1 modulo 3
    - count of number sets with even # of numbers that sums up to 1 modulo 3
    - count of number sets with odd # of numbers that sums up to 2 modulo 3
    - count of number sets with even # of numbers that sums up to 2 modulo 3
2. At the beginning, all numbers in the states are 0.
3. We start popping from the list in a while loop.
4. Take the modulo of the popped number
5. For each value of the problem state, add # of number sets that, when combined with the modulo of the popped number, contributes to that exact problem state value. (e.g. when the popped number mod 3 is 1, # of number sets with even # of numbers that sums up to 2 modulo 3 += # of sets with odd # of numberse that sums up to 1 modulo 3).
6. Also add 1 to the # of number sets with odd # of numbers that sums up to the same modulo as the number modulo 3.
7. Repeat process 4-7 until the list is empty.

### Proof

Because each number is unique, every time we pop from the list, the new element is guaranteed to form a unique combination with all existing sets; this intuitively doubles the # of existing sets and adds one other unique number as a singleton set to all existing sets.

Because sets are grouped together as counts based on them modulo 3, we can easily take the modulo 3 of the new number, add the new number to the existing set and determine from the combination of the 2 modulos, the new modulo. Then we simply increment the corresponding set count that are supposed to be incremented.

We don't need to keep track of actual members in the set as modulo and odd/evenness are the only 2 things that matter to the problem; we can gather information and mutate the problem state on the go at a constant time cost.

### Runtime

We iterate over the list of size n for once.
For each iteration, 

assuming each number in the list lies within a reasonable range(int64), mod operation on the number in the list takes constant time; 

we also have 6 arithmetic operations on each number representing the problem state. The upper bound of all of those number combined is 2^n; this is because for each iteration, we double the total number and add 1. When n approaches infinity we can treat that as doubling each time, resulting in 2^n being the upper bound, a number to be expressed in an n-bit integer.

Therefore the runtime should be O(n) with n being the size of the list.
