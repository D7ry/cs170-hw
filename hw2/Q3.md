## Q3
### Algorithm

1. The problem's state consist of 6 numbers:
    - count of number sets with odd # of numbers that sums up to 0 modulo 3
    - count of number sets with even # of numbers that sums up to 0 modulo 3
    - count of number sets with odd # of numbers that sums up to 1 modulo 3
    - count of number sets with even # of numbers that sums up to 1 modulo 3
    - count of number sets with odd # of numbers that sums up to 2 modulo 3
    - count of number sets with even # of numbers that sums up to 2 modulo 3
2. At the beginning, all numbers in the states are 0.
3. Divide the list in half, recursively call the algorithm on each half of the list.
4. At base case(list size == 1), take the modulo of the only element in the list and add it to the problem state(odd # of numbers)
5. The caller should get 2 problem state from callee, each consisting of 6 numbers. 

    - For each number in one problem state, let it form a combination with each other number in the other problem state. For each combination, add the multiplication result of the 2 numbers to the corresponding odd/even mod section of the current problem's problem state.

    - For example, if one returned problem state has 5 number sets that sums up to 0 modulo 3 and the other returned state has 2 number sets that sums up to 1 modulo 3, the current problem state should have 10 additional number sets that sums up to 1 modulo 3.

    - After accuring all the combinations of number sets, accure the numbers in the returned problem states themselves to the current problem state.

    - return the current problem state to the current function's caller.

6. Repeat process 5 until the recursion stack is empty.
7. In the final problem state, (count of number sets with odd # of numbers that sums up to 0 modulo 3) is the solution.

### Proof

Base case: algorithm is correct when the list has only 1 element, as `count of number sets with odd # of numbers that sums up to 0 modulo 3` directly contributes to the answer is the number is a multiple of 3, and not otherwise.

Inductive Hypothesis: Assume that at depth k, depth k + 1 returns 2 sets of problem states that contains correct problem states(6 numbers per state).

Inductive Step: At depth k, by accuring the new problem state using combinations of the old problem state, we get the correct count of possible combinations of sets that yields corresponding modulo results, for each number in the problem state. We multiply the counts from 2 return values of subsequent calls to account for all different combinations.

### Runtime

The algorithm divides the list up in 2 each time, resulting in a tree of log2(n) height.

Calculating modulo at root is constant.

At each level of the tree, we do a constant amount of additions and multiplications.

The sum of all numbers in the problem state is bound by 2^n. This is because if we were to take the numbers 1 by 1 from the list, and try to form different combinations of numbers, each time we take the number it doubles the # of combinations possible + 1 until the last number. This gives us O(2^n) maximum # of possible sets, and therefore all numbers in problem state is bound to be representable by an n-bit integer.

Therefore, the runtime will be O(nlog(n)^2), n being the cost of addition/multiplication at each level, one of log(n) being the number of levels, and the other being the multiplication cost(which is higher than the O(n) addition cost at each level.)
