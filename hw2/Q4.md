## Q4

### Algorithm

1. Initialize an empty set of spies.
2. Send all players to mission
3. If mission failes:
    - If there's only player among the players, the player is a spy
    - else, divide the players into 2 evenly spread group, repeat step 2-3 on the 2 groups.

### Runtime Analysis

For some players of size `n`, each time we divide the problem into 2 sets of n/2 players. However, each set has only s/n probabiliy of recurrence, assuming the spies are spread evenly. 

Each time we also consume 1 mission.

So for T(n) where T evaluates the number of missions required to find all spies, we can generalize:
```
T(n) = 2(s/n) * T(n/2) + 1
```

The expected # of missions each level of the tree generates is thus:
```
(2(s/n))^i
```

This forms a geometric series:

```
1 + (2(s/n)) + (2(s/n))^2 + (2(s/n))^3 ..... + (2(s/n)) ^ (log2(n))
```

Where r = 2(s/n)

Assuming r >1 as we're looking for the upper bound, the sum of geometric series is then `(2(s/n)) ^ (log2(n))`

Because `max(s/n) == 1`, the upper bound of the sum is then `2^(log2(n))` which evaluates to `n`




### Code

```Python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, is_sus:bool = False):
        self.__is_sus:bool = is_sus
    def is_sus(self)->bool:
        return self.__is_sus
    
class ProblemState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sus_players:set[Player]
    
def goto_mission(players:'list[Player]') -> bool:
    for player in players:
        if player.is_sus():
            return False
    return True

def find_sus(players:'list[Player]', state:ProblemState):
    if goto_mission(players) is True:
        return # mission success, no amongus
    
    num_players:int = len(players)
    if (num_players == 1):
        state.sus_players.add(players[0]) # found you
    
    split_point:int = num_players // 2
    first_group:'list[Player]' = players[split_point:]
    second_group:'list[Player]' = players[:split_point]
    
    find_sus(first_group, state)
    find_sus(second_group, state)

find_sus([Player(), Player(True), Player(), Player(), Player(True), Player(True)], ProblemState())
```
